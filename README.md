----

This is (almost certainly) not the package you are looking for.
The primary reason this is [published on PyPi][published] is so I can create reproducible Jupyter Notebooks.

See the [documentation] for use (or not) and [reasons why this exists](https://jpgoldberg.github.io/toy-crypto-math/#motivation).

Note that if you need to do cryptography in Python, I recommend [pyca](https://cryptography.io/).
If you want tools to explore the algebraic and number theoretic constructs used in cryptography,
look at [SageMath](https://doc.sagemath.org/).
